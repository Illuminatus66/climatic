                  This is the all new Climaticâ„¢ app. With us, you can choose to
                  either get the weather as an{" "}
                  <strong>unauthenticated user</strong>, which will enable you
                  to double-click anywhere on the map provided by Mapbox. Then
                  consequently, you'll be able to{" "}
                  <strong>
                    view the weather data for 2 days inside an HTML table.
                  </strong>{" "}
                  Beware! You won't be able to download this data because the
                  table refreshes after every double-click.
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    <br />
                    If you do decide to sign-in, you gain the perks to search
                    for your desired location in the Geocoder support, also
                    provided by Mapbox.
                    <br />
                    Apart from being able search and locate, you'll be able to{" "}
                    <strong>fetch weather data for 3 days</strong>, ie. the
                    current day and two consecutive days. The data will be{" "}
                    <strong>stored indefinitely</strong> and can be downloaded
                    using our simple and intuitive UI.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  The weather data provided by Tomorrow.io contains various
                  parameters such as:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Temperature and Apparent Temperature</li>
                    <li>Humidity</li>
                    <li>Rainfall Probablity and Intensity</li>
                    <li>Cloud Cover</li>
                    <li>UV Index</li>
                    <li>Visibility</li>
                    <li>Pressure at Sea Level</li>
                    <li>Sunrise and Sunset Time</li>
                    <li>Wind Speed</li>
                    <li>Dew Point</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    To fetch the stored data, you can specify the date range and
                    fetch the data from MongoDB Atlas. You can then easily
                    download the data in four different formats based upon your
                    needs. The most useful one, is obviously the{" "}
                    <strong>.json</strong> file format which is the most
                    beautiful way to display nested data. If your needs fall in
                    the data analytics or machine learning disciplines, a{" "}
                    <strong>.csv</strong> file might be what you need, and we
                    have that too! A simple text or <strong>.txt</strong> file
                    might be what you want but that gets more and more verbose
                    as you keep on using the app. In that case, you might want
                    to choose an <strong>.xlsx</strong> file because no amount
                    of data can faze the trusty old Excel file format.

                After signing-in you can either search for the location you want

                weather data that you have previously searched for, using the

                You can only interact with the Geocoder 5 times per day as an

                <br />
                for very few forward-geocoding requests per month. Since
                Climaticâ„¢ doesn't offer a paid-tier, hence we cannot afford to
                <br />
                breach the limits of the free-tier provided by either Mapbox or
                Tomorrow.io.
